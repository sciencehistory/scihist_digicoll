# DZI files (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom) are stored on S3 using
# a keypath template:
#
#     ./{asset uuid}/{md5 hash}.dzi
#     ./{asset uuid}/{md5 hash}_files/{lots of tiles}
#
# The `x.dzi` manifest file corresponding to an `x_files` directory full of
# hieararchical tiles, is part of the DZI format.
#
# This class will use S3 API to iterate through all files found on an S3 bucket, looking
# for .dzi files to check.  In order to do that, it actually needs to do two sets of iteration --
# first iterating through the top level to find all `{uuid}` directories, then for each one,
# iterating through it's contents to find ".dzi" files.
#
# For each .dzi file found,it'll check to make sure an asset with the UUID encoded in path exists,
# and it has the MD5 encoded in path -- if not, the `x.dzi` file (and all of it's corresponding tiles)
# are "orphaned", and no longer correspond to an existing asset, and should be deleted.
# This class can also delete them.
#
# The checker ONLY checks `.dzi` files, and if it finds an "orphan" deletes the .dzi file and
# it's associated `_files` "folder". It will not even check other files that don't even end
# in .dzi.
#
# The double/nested iteration required to find all .dzi files using available S3 API and when
# they are ararnged as they are, when run over our current ~25K .dzi files, takes around
# 12 minutes to run on our EC2 instances, and costs around 12 cents every time you run it.
# The time and cost could be reduced significantly if we reorganized the keypath arrangement.
#
# We could consider switching to a layout more like chf_sufia used, where there isn't
# an `{asset uuid}/` component in the path, but all .dzi files and _files folders
# are siblings next to each other, and the asset uuid is encoded directly in the .dzi/_files name.
# It turns out that makes it much more convenient to more quickly find just the top-level .dzi
# files, using the S3 'delimiter' API. And allows report/delete in more like 5 minutes. But
# would require a reorganization of our many gigs of DZI files, which is hard to do on S3.
