# Derivatives are stored  on S3 at:

#
# The `./` may be bucket root, or may be at a prefix inside a bucket, depending on
# how our `shrine-shrine_derivatives_storage` is configured.
#
# This class will use S3 API to iterate through ALL keys in configured shrine_store_storage,
# for each one try to parse out the UUID-pk and derivatie key from path. Then it will look
# in the postgres database to make sure a corresponding Derivative row exists, and points to the
# found object on S3.
#
# If all those things are not true, the S3 key is considered "orphaned". This class can be used to
# report on all discovered orphaned files, or to actually _delete_ orphaned files.  This class
# is normally called from a rake task.
#
# Certain things we store in the derivatives bucket but which are not derivatives, are intentionally
# ignored (eg in "__sitemaps/")
