# Our original files in S3 are stored with keypaths with template:
#
#    ./{model_name}/{uuid_pk}/{random.suffix}
#
# Eg,
#
#    /asset/00968a6c-957a-46a9-817a-a7893aeafed0/0be15a7ad6a89091ad650e498dc5ffb2.jpg

# The `./` may be bucket root, or may be at a prefix inside a bucket, depending on
# how our `shrine-store_storage` is configured.
#
# This class will use S3 API to iterate through ALL keys in configured shrine_store_storage,
# for each one try to parse out the UUID-pk from the path, and check the postgres database
# to make sure an Asset with that pk exists, and it is pointing to the found file on S3.
#
# If both those things are not true, it is considered 'orphaned'. This class can be used to
# report on all discovered orphaned files, or to actually _delete_ orphaned files.  This class
# is normally called from a rake task.
