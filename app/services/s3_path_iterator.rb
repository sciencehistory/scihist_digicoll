# Just encapsulates some common functionality for iterating through files on S3,
# with a progress bar. Used by the various orphan file checkers.
#
# @example
#
#     iterator = S3PathIterator.new(bucket)
#     iterator.each_s3_path do |s3_path|
#       iterator.log "We found this S3 path: #{s3_path}"
#     end

  # @param shrine_storage [Shrine::Storage] the Shrine::Storage indicating an S3 bucket
  #   we're going to list keys off of. It can have a `prefix` set on it, in which case
  #   we'll only iterate within that prefix (although complete keys are still yielded)
  #
  # @param extra_prefix [String] Additional keypath prefix to iterate within, will be
  #   added onto any prefix already built into bucket. eg "foo/bar".
  #
  # @param first_level_only [Boolean] Default false, if true we'll iterate S3 passing
  #   `delimiter: '/'`, meaning we'll only return hiearchically top-level keys, ie files
  #   or "directories" directly at the prefix(es) specified.
  #
  # @param show_progress_bar [Boolean] show a progress bar!
  #
  # @param progress_bar_total [Integer] if using show_progress_bar, pass this in unless you want
  #   an indeterminate 'spinner' progress bar.
