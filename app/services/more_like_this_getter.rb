# MoreLikeThisGetter.new(work).works
#
# returns an array of zero to ten
# published works that SOLR thinks
# are "like" the given work.
# The array is in order: the first item in
# the one SOLR deemed most "alike".
#
# This calls the SOLR server's more-like-this request handler
# at http://SOME_URL/solr/SOME_CORE/mlt
#
# See also:
# work_indexer.rb for indexing details,
# solr/config/solrconfig.xml for the request handler.
#
# We really do not want to slow down (or worse, break) the work show page
# if SOLR is slow or unreachable, as it often is.
# If anything goes wrong, you'll just get an empty array.
