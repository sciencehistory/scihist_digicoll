# A thumb, usually with 'view' and 'download' buttons below it. We call that the "member image" presentation.
# Naming is hard!
#
# (Descended from app/views/curation_concerns/base/_show_page_image.html.erb in chf_sufia)
#
# Could be a child work, could be an Asset. If it's a child work, it doesn't get view/download buttons,
# but instead gets an "Info" button linking to child work. (That is just a legacy decision cause it was
# easier to implement -- for child work that has _multiple_ Assets attached to it, unclear what a good UX
# is. It could be changed later.)
#
# The MemberImage can actually be of mutiple sizes, the large poster size for the "hero" section
# of page (pass in `size: :large`, :large size thumb will be used), or the more standard size (`size: :standard`,
# standard thumb, default).
#
# And can also be lazy-loading or not.
#
# You pass in a Work or Asset -- a direct member, not a leaf_representative.
#
# Note that we will need to access the leaf_representative and it's
# derivatives, so if displaying a list of multiple (as you usually will be), you should
# eager load these. You DO NOT
# pass in the leaf_representative itself, pass in the member -- we need to know about it
# to know what to display.
#
# ## Access Control
#
# This component WILL refuse to show something the user does not have permission to see,
# as a fail-safe guard. It will just show our placeholder image in that case.
#
# In general, we intend the front-end to NOT try to put these on the page at all,
# we don't want to show people the placeholder, this is just a fail-safe to avoid
# showing non-public content in case of other errors.
