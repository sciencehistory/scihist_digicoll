    # Quite similar to Rails' ActiveSupport::NumberHelper.number_to_human_size
    # But it turns out that Rails `number_to_human_size` is pretty expensive, expensive
    # enough to be a huge problem when we are calling this for each derivative for each member page
    # on a work page when displaying.
    #
    # So this is a much simpler version, that doens't get all the edge cases quite as nice,
    # or handle significant digits as nicely, and doesn't do I81n for units (that is
    # perhaps the main slowdown in Rails), but works quite good enough and is so much faster.

    # Implementation cribbed and adapted from a StackOverflow answer somewhere.
