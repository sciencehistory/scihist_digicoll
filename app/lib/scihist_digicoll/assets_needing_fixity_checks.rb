  # Running fixity checks takes a while, so we want to spread
  # the job out over a week or so. The current recipe will:
  #
  #  * Check all the assets if you run the rake task 7 times.
  #  * Check the same number of assets every day.
  #
  # asset_ids tries to find the ids for the assets that need to
  # be checked the most urgently.
  #
  # Assets with NO CHECK on record at all are picked first.
  # Then come assets whose MOST RECENT CHECK is the OLDEST.
  #
  # If you run the check once a day, the items will be checked
  # roughly once a week if cycle_length == 7.
  #
  # Note: if you pass in 0 as the cycle length, you just get all the assets.

    # @param cycle_length [Integer] We will prepare for checking 1/cycle_length
    # assets, the ones most in need of checking (cause they have no checks on record
    # or oldest checks on record). The idea is you want all assets to be checked weekly,
    # you run nightly with cycle_length 7. Which is the default. `0` means "all assets".

    # Gives you a way to iterate over all assets to check. You can call it with a block:
    #
    #     assets_needing.assets_to_check { |asset_model| ... }
    #
    # But using some ruby Enumerator cleverness, you can call it without a block to get an
    # Enumerator back, which lets you chain methods like `each_slice` onto it, which is actually
    # what our intended caller does.
    #
    # The implementation fetches 200 (BATCH_FETCH_SIZE) of the Assets with stalest
    # fixity checks in; and keeps doing that in batches of 200 until all the assets
    # we desire to fetch (based on total number of assets divide by CYCLE_LENGTH) have
    # been fetched.
    #
    # This weird implementation is needed to avoid fetching everything into memory at once,
    # without using ActiveRecord's `find_each` batching, becuase previous attempts
    # to use `find_each` seemed to run into trouble with race-conditions caused by editing the database
    # to add fixity checks records, in a way that affected the conditions of the `find_each`,
    # and may have resulted in ending up checking everything. The trick here is to avoid
    # fetching everything into memory, including huge lists of IDs, or making SQL involving
    # lists of hundreds/thousands of IDs, while still batching fetching multiple objects
    # per SQL select.
