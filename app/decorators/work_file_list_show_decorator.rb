# A work show page, motivated by Oral Histories that require a form fill out
# to get access to media files, and do not have OHMS or publicly playable audio.
#
# Our normal work show page really highlights thumbnails, including a large poster
# thumb. But PDFs (and a/v) aren't really image media, and aren't really served by that.
# So this one has more of a file-listing approach.
#
# Might be usable in other contexts where you want a more file-listing approach,
# but links and download options might not be right, beware. We do not ever
# include a link to the viewer here, and don't do DownloadOoptions, just
# a single download button.
