# Serialize Work metadata as JSON
#
# This is pretty much our internal data format exposed in JSON.
#
# While we aspire for this to be a stable API for external partners, and will do our best
# to keep it so, significant internal data format changes will likely cause changes to
# this serialization. It's really an internal format exposed.
#
# Consumers could consider the OAI_DC serialization as more stable (although currently
# including fewer fields); we could add fields to that serialization with standard
# identifiers, or consider other future alternate standard serializations.
