These are images for use with the Collection "FundingCredit" information.

See ./app/models/funding_credit.rb.

For now, instead of allowing staff to upload images for "funding credit", we
just hard-code them app source, in a constnat in FundingCredit, with images living here.

They should be square, probably 112px x 112px (or maybe 224x224 for double resolution?)

This is hacky, but we're not going to use this feature very much probably, it works for now.
