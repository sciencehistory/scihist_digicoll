// This is a sprockets manifest file.
//
// We don't use sprockets anymore generally, we use vite. But for blacklight_range_limit,
// there wasn't really a feasible way to get JS and CSS but sprockets, so sprockets JS and CSS
// files remain only for sprockets, and are referenced directly in our layout files.
//
// Note this file can't be named "blacklight_range_limit.js" itslef, or it conflicts
// with the file from the gem we're trying to require!

//= require 'blacklight_range_limit'
