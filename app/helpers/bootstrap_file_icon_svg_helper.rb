# We want just a few Boostrap Icon SVGs, included inline, so we can style them
# with CSS.
#
# pasting them into helper methods is just the simplest way that could possibly
# work, and good enough for now -- if we wanted more than a few of these, we'd
# have to do something more sophisticated.
#
# These are taken from bootstrap icons v1.11.0 https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
# , which is permissively MIT licensed.
#
# BUT then also edited to remove right/left padding, cause work better for us
# like that.
