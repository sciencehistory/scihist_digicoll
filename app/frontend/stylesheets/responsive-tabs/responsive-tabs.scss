/**
  ** This is adapted from very clever progressive-responsive bootstrap tabs code at:
  *      https://github.com/localnetwork/bootstrap4-responsive-tabs
  *
  *  * Fixed a bug for bootstrap 4.6.0 https://github.com/localnetwork/bootstrap4-responsive-tabs/pull/2
  *
  *  * Turned it into a sass mixin, so we can REPEAT it more than once, for DIFFERENT breakpoints.
  *    Because we needed a different one for our primary use case.
  *
  *   After creating the mixin, in this same file we create responsive tab classes at various
  *   breakpoints with eg:
  *
  *       @include responsive-tabs("md", somePixels);
  *
  *   Which creates clases for eg `responsive-tabs-md`.
  *
  *   Then over in ./app/javascript/src/js/responsive-tabs/responsive-tabs.js
  *    we
  *   automatically apply responsive behavior to any bootstrap tabs
  *   with `data-trigger="responsive-tabs-md" attribute (note the `-md` on the end)
  *
  *   In facct, we are currently creating responsive breakpoints for `responsive-tabs-md`
  *   (original breakpoint from vendor), and `responsive-tabs-lg` at bootstrap breakpoint `lg`.
