// Our full-width sections need:
//   1. padding (which we use to provide visual margins) so on smaller width screens
//      they have the correct margins --with a media query, as we have smaller
//      margins on extra-small screens.
//
//   2. A max-width, with horizontal centering, so on LARGER screens the content
//      does not go beyond a certain width. (At the point max-width kicks in,
//      padding/marigns no longer matter, because it's being centered)
//
// Both of these things need to match header/footer, so margins always line up.
//
// This mixin can be used to give these things to a section.
//
// No vertical padding/margins are provided by this mixin, those are on you.
//
// If the section needs a background (eg color), it needs an outer container div
// around the one with shi-full-width-inner-mixin to provide the background.
// This is why the mixin is called "-inner"
//
// This functionality is availabile as this mixin, or if it's easier as a CLASS
// at .shi-full-width-inner
//
