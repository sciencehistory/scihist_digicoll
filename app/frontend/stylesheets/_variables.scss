/* NEW 2023 Brand colors */
// First, variated colors from the Brand Guide which has 7 colors with four shades each,
// from 1=lightest to 4=darkest.
//
// We leave out `blue` and `purple` because we do not use them at all at present.
//
// Secondly, we'll have some semantic/mnemonic aliases for the colors we actually use
// and how we use them

// Grand guide calls this "black", and recommends it for all(?) black uses,
// but main website uses pure black for text still.
