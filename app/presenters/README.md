In ./app/presenters we just have some "plain ruby" classes that we use for presentation/view layer logic.

Some people would put any/all "plain ruby" objects in ./app/models or whatever, but this seemed a good category of things to seperate out.

Perhaps some overlap with ./app/services, and see also our ViewComponent-based objects in ./app/components.
