# A ViewModel presenter that displays an image tag, for a thumbnail derivative for a given Kithe::Asset.
#
# The Kithe::Asset provided as an arg will usually be a leaf_representative of a Work or Collection.
#
#     <%= ThumbDisplay.new(work.leaf_representative).display %>
#
# In a search results list, leaf_representatives should be eager loaded to avoid n+1 queries in search results display.
#
# * ThumbDisplay uses `srcset` tag for high-res images on high-res displays, using our _2x derivatives.
#
# * By default it will display thumb size `standard`, suitable for use in results display, but you
#   can supply any other thumb size we support, eg, :mini, :large, or for collections :collection_page
#
# * Optionally pass `lazy:true` to produce an image tag suitable for lazyloading with lazysizes.js,
#   https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes , including a data-aspectratio tag for
#   https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/tree/gh-pages/plugins/aspectratio
#
# ## Placeholders
#
# By default, if suitable derivatives can't be found, it will use our standard placeholder image. Alternate
# placeholders can be specified (such as our collection defaut icon). Note that most of our placeholders
# are svg's, which may not have internal widths specified, so image tags should always be in containers
# with a CSS width/max-width -- and should usually have their own CSS width set to 100% --
# and you should probably manually visually test your layout with placeholders.
#
# ## Note: access control
#
# ThumbDisplay does NOT do any access control, it will display whatever you give it, if it can,
# even if not published with no logged in user. Access control should be done by caller.
