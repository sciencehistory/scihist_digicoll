  # What is total number of derivatives referenced in our DB?
  #
  # Since they are now referenced as keys inside a JSON hash in Asset, it's a bit
  # tricky to count. We use some rough SQL to ask postgres how many keys there are in
  # `derivatives` hashes in `file_data` json hash in Assets.
  #
  # Seems to work. Might be a little bit expensive, does not use indexes and requires a complete
  # table scan, but pg exact counts actually always require a table scan, and at our present
  # scale this is still pretty quick.
  #
  # TODO: We should probably extract this to kithe.
