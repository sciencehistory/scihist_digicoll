  #
  # This is a sort of "wrapper" (delegator/proxy, "form object") around a work, meant for use with the
  # Batch Update form -- we wrap it so we can _remove_ certain validations, so we can validate
  # batch edit entry but not have it fail on things like "needs an external_id" -- batch edit
  # instructions don't need an external id!
  #
  # In fact, we just remove all "presence" validations. But we still want validations like "Creator
  # can't have a blank role" -- and we want them to be displayed nicely on the batch edit form.
  #
  # Additioally, we want simple_form's introspection into validations to _also_ not find the
  # "presence" ones, so it won't mark them as "required".
  #
  # So a BatchUpdatetWorkValidator should end up looking pretty much just like a Work, through
  # the magic of delegation, but without those validations.
  #
  # Getting this to work is pretty hacky, and required some reverse engineering of Rails and simple_form,
  # indeed it's not great. But this seems to be the simplest way
  # to be able to re-use our forms and validation and error-displaying code from Work edit.
  #
  # We also have the logic for actually doing the update in here. Normally it will look like this:
  #
  #     @work = BatchUpdateWorkForm.new(work_params)
  #     result = @work.update_works(current_user.works_in_cart.find_each)
  #     # if result is false, then it failed, and there are @work.errors to look at.
  #
  # A BatchUpdateWorkForm instance should be more or less interchangeable with a work,
  # especially for passing to simple_form to create a form, and display errors, etc.
