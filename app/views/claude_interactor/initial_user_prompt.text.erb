## USER QUESTION
<%= question %>


## TASK

- Answer using only information from the provided context chunks that addresses the question
- Output a single valid JSON object with the specified format (no code fences, preambles, or external text)
- For questions requiring synthesis across multiple interviews, cite all relevant sources
- If you find contradictory information, note this and cite both sources
- If retrieved chunks contain no directly relevant information, set "answer_unavailable": true.


## RETRIEVAL SCOPE

- We are supplying <%= chunks.count %> chunks, from <%= chunk_works_count %> of <%= oral_histories_searched_count %> total interviews searched.
- These chunks were identified by a semantic similarity search as most related to the user question, and are not a comprehensive sample.
- Other passages may exist with relevance to the question that are not included here.
