## USER QUESTION
<%= question %>


## TASK

- Answer using only information from the provided context chunks that addresses the question
- Output a single valid JSON object with the specified format (no code fences, preambles, or external text)
- If retrieved chunks contain no directly relevant information, set "answer_unavailable": true.


## RETRIEVAL SCOPE

- We are supplying <%= chunks.count %> chunks, from <%= chunk_works_count %> of <%= oral_histories_searched_count %> total interviews searched.
- These chunks were identified by a semantic similarity search as most related to the user question, and are not a comprehensive sample.
- Other passages may exist with relevance to the question that are not included here.
- Quantitative or exhaustive questions cannot be answered from this sample.  If the user asks for quantitative or exhaustive answers, or otherwise requests complete enumeration or quantification, you must clarify in the introduction with a disclaimer that you can only provide examples, not totals or complete lists from the full collection.
- Quantitative questions include those asking "how many", "what percentage", or asking for counts or calculations of counts.
- Exhaustive questions include those by explicitly asking for "all", "every", "list"; or implicitly asking "who", "which".
- If a question is ambiguous as to whether it's meant to be exhaustive or not, assume it's meant to be exhaustive for purposes of establishing scope for disclaimers.
