# A controller for delivering our originals and assets to browser, via a redirect to an
# S3 url.
#
# send to `/downloads/:asset_friendlier_id` (`downloads_path(asset)`)  or
# `/downloads/:asset_friendlier_id/:derivative_key` (`downloads_derivative_path(asset, derivative_key)`)
#
# And a REDIRECT will be returned to an S3 asset, via a signed S3 url.
#
# The signed S3 urls generated will request a content-disposition header from S3, that
# will set a download filename based on current parent work and/or Asset metadata. For
# instance, based on Work title. This means it may not match the actual key/URL on S3,
# and can change when Work/Asset metadata changes without needing to change actual key/URL
# on S3.  See DownloadFilenameHelper for actual filename-generation logic, used here.
#
# However, since we are delivering a signed URL to do this (as well as give access to S3
# assets that may not be public -- after verifying auth), it also means the particular
# URL redirected to is unique to request, will expire, and is not generally cachable
# (either by shared HTTP caches or even specific browser-caches -- since you will never
# get the same URL twice).
#
# So this is an unfortuante tradeoff, and due to the redirect to an uncacheable URL, we
# do NOT use this controller for actual image and media source (eg`src` attribute on an `img`)
# for displaying in the browser -- for those we currently deliver the direct S3 URL to a
# _public_ S3 asset.
#
# So this controller is usually used for acutal downloads, although sending
# ?disposition=inline will result in an 'inline' disposition header, which we use for instance
# for asking the browser to display a PDF directly (if the browser can), which we may use
# for 'view' function on a PDF.  Even when being delivered with disposition inline, the
# content-disposition header still has a filename set, so if the user chooses 'save as'
# from their browser, they will still get our specified filename instead of just a filename
# based on S3 URL. Which is neat.
#
class DownloadsController < ApplicationController
  # Will be sent to S3 as expires_in, seconds, max 1 week.
