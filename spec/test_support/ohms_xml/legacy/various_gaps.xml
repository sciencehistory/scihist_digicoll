He graduated from Columbia in 1888.
I feel confident that if he had lived a little later, 
he would have been a physical chemist, because his interests
lay along those lines of physical chemistry. He was not interested
in descriptive geology or paleontology but he wanted to know how
things got there. He was interested in the structure of things.
My father&#039;s first cousin was a professor of chemistry at Vassar College.
She was not a research chemist and she left Vassar to become
president of Connecticut College. That shows a beginning interest
in science.

My father
was a
great believer
in
scientific research,

so I was brought up to believe that that was a great thing to do.
It spread through the family. My brother [Henry DeWolf Smyth]
is a physicist. He was chairman of the physics department here.
Frederic Hastings Smyth, my first cousin on the Smyth side,
took a Ph.D. in physical chemistry at MIT, and was in the
Chemical Warfare Service during the war. As a matter of fact,
he devised the crossed alembics over a benzene ring which
was the symbol of the Chemical Warfare Service that officers
wore on their collars. He went into industry for a year or two
and was with a geophysical lab for a few years. He had independent
means and quit. After studying philosophy and religion, he became
an Episcopal clergyman and founded his own small order.
That was not very scientific.</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights></rights><fmt>audio</fmt><usage></usage><userestrict>0</userestrict><xmllocation></xmllocation><xmlfilename></xmlfilename><collection_link></collection_link><series_link></series_link></record></ROOT>
