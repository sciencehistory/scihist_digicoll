00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Sample Time Stamp Document (with fake interview content)<br><br>How it looks when exported from Sonix: Time stamps are to the left of the speaker names here. There is a time stamp and speaker name at each paragraph change.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:18.000
<v SCHNEIDER>  Today is December 16, 2024. I am Sarah Schneider and I am conducting an oral history interview with name of interviewee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Science History Institute. I wanted to start off by asking you about your childhood in Washington, DC. What was it like growing up there?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000
<v NAME OF INTERVIEWEE>  It was a lot of fun growing up there. I had five siblings and we were always going on adventures around town, like visiting museums and monuments. We lived near the subway so it was easy to travel around town.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v SCHNEIDER>  Did you have a favorite museum to visit? What kinds of other activities were you involved in as a child?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
<v NAME OF INTERVIEWEE>  I liked the Museum of Natural History quite a bit. We always went there. I memorized some of the text in the exhibits, and the staff got to know me because I was there so much on summer breaks. I think that was part of what led to my interest in science and interest in learning.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.000
<v NAME OF INTERVIEWEE>  One day, we got lost on our way home. We went a different direction and I had trouble finding my way. It was confusing because there was some construction, so I couldn’t follow the normal path that we would take.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:14.000
<v NAME OF INTERVIEWEE>  Another time, we were outside walking around a park and saw the President! We would see the motorcade go by quite frequently, but this time, he was walking around and greeting people, shaking their hands. We almost got to meet him, but then he had to leave by the time he would have made our way towards us.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
<v SCHNEIDER>  Wow, that sounds like a memorable experience. Did you spend all of your childhood in DC?

00:01:22.000 --> 01:00:03.000
<v NAME OF INTERVIEWEE>  Yes, I lived there my whole childhood. But my parents have since moved into the suburbs in Maryland.<br><br> How the document will look after our formatting: Time stamps are on the line above the speaker name. There is only one time stamp per speaker change (so when someone speaks for a while with multiple paragraph breaks, there is only a time stamp before the first paragraph for that set of speech, until someone else speaks).<br><br>We can use the advanced find and replace function to add line breaks before the speaker names to move each time stamp to the line prior: Find what box: Type in the name of a speaker and colon [for example: “SCHNEIDER:”]<br><br>Replace with box: Choose “Special” and select “Manual Line Break” and then type in the speaker name and colon (no space between the line break symbol and name). It should look like: For interviewer<br><br>Find what box: “SCHNEIDER:” (no quotes typed in)<br><br>Replace with box: “^lSCHNEIDER:” (no quotes typed in)<br><br>Replace All<br><br>Repeat this process for each of the speakers in the interview
