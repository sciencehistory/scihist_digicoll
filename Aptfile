# We need `pdfunite` command line thatcomes from poppler; While the `heroku-buildpack-activestorage-preview`
# should provide it too, it seems to be unpredictable as to whether it does, in ways that
# actually disturb our understanding of heroku reproducibility (different results on identical
# heroku stacks/buildpacks).  Supplying it here on top of activestorage-preview buildpack
# doesn't seem to hurt, and does seem to get us a working poppler reliably.
