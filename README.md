# Science History Institute Digital Collections

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sciencehistory/scihist_digicoll.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sciencehistory/scihist_digicoll)

In progress re-write of our Digital Collections application.

This one is based on the [kithe](https://github.com/sciencehistory/kithe) toolkit, being developed in tandem.

## Development

To set up a development instance on your workstation.

Prequisites:

* ruby installed (I like using chruby and ruby-build to install/manage rubies, some like rvm)
  * `gem install bundler` on new ruby installation
* (MacOS) XCode installed so C dependencies can be compiled
* Postgres installed and running -- on MacOS, I like https://postgresapp.com/

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sciencehistory/scihist_digicoll.git
$ cd scihist_digicoll
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
```

Run app with `./rails server`, it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running tests

`./bin/rspec`.
