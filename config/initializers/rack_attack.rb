# counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
# quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

#
# But we're going to try a more generous 3 per second over
# 1 minute instead.

  # we still include them in tracking logging below.

# of understanding what's going on in our logs

# And we want to log rack-attack track and throttle  notifications. But we get
# a notification every time an IP has exceeded the limit -- that's far too
# many to log every time, could be many per second when it's exceeding limits.
#
# We want to log once per period of our limits -- eg one minute, for records.
#
# But we want to ALERT us even less than that -- say once per day -- so we
# log a special log line with 'ALERT' in it even less frequently, that we
# can have papertrail set an alert for us on, on the string: `rack_attack: ALERT`.
# We also do reverse IP lookup on the less frequent ALERTS.
#
# To do this, we need to store and consult some state about the last time(s)
# we logged, which we do in the cache that rack-attackc is already using
# (probably the Rails.cache which is probably a memcached)
#
# The implementation of all of this is currently kind of squirrely and hard
# to follow, sorry.
