    hints:
      work:
        title: >
          Use the work’s full, given title when available; otherwise, construct a brief descriptive title that uniquely identifies the work. Use title case (ex: "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog") for formal and published titles and sentence case (ex: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") for constructed and supplied titles. Required.
        additional_title: >
          Use for additional or varying forms of a title if it contributes to further identification of the work. Record subtitles or English translations of the title here. Required if applicable.
        external_id: >
          A reference to the physical work, consisting of a character or number string that identifies the resource. Enter the physical work’s identifier: its Bibliographic number, Object ID, Accession number, ArchivesSpace Reference number, or Oral History Interview Number. Use multiple IDs to distinguish the particular holding of a work with multiple copies. The external ID does not necessarily have to be unique but should point to a source record. Required.
        creator: >
          Any individual, group, or organization responsible for the work, either primarily or more auxiliary, if relevant. Input the agent’s name from a controlled vocabulary when possible. This field currently auto-suggests FAST headings (from Library of Congress Authorities). If a FAST heading does not exist for the person or entity associated with the work, search the Library of Congress Name Authority File. Denote specific creator roles when possible; otherwise, Creator and Contributor can be used as default roles. Required if applicable.
        date_of_work: "Date(s) of creation or publication. Three levels of granularity can be used for precise dates—year (<code>YYYY</code>), year-month (<code>YYYY-MM</code>), and year-month-day (<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>). Input discrete dates into the Start field. For date ranges or uncertainties, accepted formats are <code>YYYY-YYYY</code>,  <code>before YYYY</code>,  <code>after YYYY</code>,  <code>circa YYYY</code>,  <code>YYY0 decade</code>, <code>YY00 century</code>, or <code>Undated</code>. (Note: <code>Undated</code> should only be used if no other date is available or can be inferred). For dates expressed in alternative formats or systems, record the original value as is in Note, which will display in parentheses after the W3C date. Required."
        place: >
          Location of origin for the work. Insert geographic regions including neighborhoods, city, state, or countries. This field currently auto-suggests FAST headings. If a FAST heading does not exist for the place associated with the work, search Library of Congress Authorities for an appropriate heading. Use the modern name for the geographic region as is found in a controlled heading. Specify the type of place in the dropdown. If the place is unknown, use a broad estimate of the location, such as the country or state name of creation for works which the city of origin is unknown, or leave the field blank if this is not possible. Required if applicable.
        format: "Format in which the work is expressed. Select the content type(s) that best reflects the original work and not the digital resource. Use \"Moving image\" if you would like to display video. Required."
        genre: >
          The nature of the work, covering aspects such as content, form, function, physical character, style, or technique. Input the genre term(s) which best describes what the work is, not what it is about. In general, use broad values, accompanied by more specific values as necessary. Specific values, such as Engraving, Glassware, or Slides must be accompanied by their corresponding general term such as Prints, Artifacts, or Photographs respectively.  If a desired term is not available, contact the Digital Collections Librarian. Required.
        medium: >
          List the materials which make up the physical work. Use terms from the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus where possible. Input terms in the order of which they make up the object from most to least prevalent. Use primarily for works with a format of “Physical Objects,” though bibliographic works with unique materials such as parchment, metal fasteners, or dye samples may include this field. Optional.
        extent: >
          Use for the size or duration of the work. Input numerical values up to two decimal places. If the value is less than one, precede the decimal point with a zero. Use metric units of measurement when applicable and lowercase letters for units of measurement. Specify dimensional sides as W (width) x H (height) x L (length) or D (Diameter). For Oral Histories, include the number of transcript pages as # pages and the total audio running time in hours, minutes, and seconds as #h #m #s. For archival works with several items included in one digital record, specify the item belonging to each measurement e.g., "20 cm W x 16 cm H (envelope)" or input the largest item’s dimensions, followed by "(and smaller)." Optional.
        language: >
          Refers to language of the intellectual content of the work. Input the language(s) of the work being described, even if it is a translation or if the original is in a different language. Leave blank for any works without a lingual or textual element. This field will autocomplete languages from a local vocabulary. If the desired language is not available, chose a term from ISO-639 language codes. Required if applicable.
        description: >
          Summary, highlights, or other contextual information about the work. Use full sentences for descriptive text. Enter specialized or additional information not included in other fields and consider using keywords that users may search for. Existing abstracts can also be copied from available sources. Include a description of the physical qualities of the object when applicable, and an explanation of any graphic qualities in consideration of visually impaired users. Only exclude a description if there is no other verified or known information about the work that is not already conveyed in other metadata fields. Allowed HTML tags: <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>cite</code>, <code>a</code>. Optional.
        provenance: >
          A history of the object's ownership. Applies to Museum works, Archival works, and Rare Books. For fine art materials, input provenance information following the provenance style guide. Provenance information can either be found in Past Perfect or within provenance files in the Museum department. Per the style guide, you may add notes at the bottom. Separate notes from the rest of the info using the word "Notes:" on its own line. For rare books and archives, follow the same general principles as museum objects, using a narrative form to include information about donors or auctions when applicable. Allowed HTML tags: <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>cite</code>, <code>a</code>. Required if applicable.
        inscription: >
          Use for text on a work that is captioned, dedicated, or inscribed. Specify inscription location and transcribe the text exactly as is on the work, including capturing misspellings, cross-outs, or other anomalies as they appear. Use non-bibliographic terms like “front” and “back” instead of “recto” or “verso.” Required if applicable.
        digitization_funder: >
          Text defining person(s) or organization(s) responsible for funding the digitization of work. “Digitization and cataloging of this item made possible through the generosity of [name of donor or funder]." Where applicable, add "in honor of [name(s)]" after donor's name(s) if donor specified named individual(s) for acknowledgement. Required if applicable.
        subject: >
          Topical terms describing the “aboutness” of the work. This field currently auto-suggests FAST headings (from Library of Congress Authorities). If a FAST heading does not exist for the person or entity associated with the work, search Library of Congress Subject Headings.  Use subjects to answer what, who, when, and where the work is about. Subject headings may include topics, events, geographic locations, people, and organizations/institutions. Required (at least one).

          Archival materials only: specify series and subseries of work, where relevant. Capture the information as listed in the finding aid. Required if applicable.
        physical_container: >
          The physical location of a work in an archival collection or, alternatively, a work’s placement in a series (non-archival) or monograph. For archival materials, specify box and folder container numbers, where relevant. For serialized materials, specify volume and part numbers, where relevant. Include shelfmark information when applicable. For partially digitized bibliographic items, indicate the pages within a larger work included in the record. Required if applicable.
