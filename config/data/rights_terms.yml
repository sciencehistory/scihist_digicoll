# Data format was originally inherited from `qa` gem, but this data/logic
# has been extracted to no longer have anything to do with `qa`, and has been
# altered somewhat.
#
# "id" is what's actually stored in the DB, always URI.
# "label" is what's shown to managers in form interface.
# "short_label_html" is what's shown in our public UI, and is html-safe so it can include <br>s
# "category" is used in our public UI to determine correct icon.
# I think "active" may currently be ignored.
#
# Order matters, in that order listed is order they will show up in edit form select.
