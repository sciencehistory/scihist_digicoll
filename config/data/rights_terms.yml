# Data format was originally inherited from `qa` gem, but this data/logic
# has been extracted to no longer have anything to do with `qa`, and has been
# altered somewhat.
#
# "id" is what's actually stored in the DB, always URI.
# "label" is what's shown to managers in form interface.
# "short_label_html" is what's shown in our public UI, and is html-safe so it can include <br>s
# "category" is used in our public UI to determine correct icon, it must be one of in_copyright,
#    no_copyright, or other. https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en
#    OR creative_commons, which gets special treatment.
#
# I think "active" may currently be ignored.
#
# icon_alt is important for accessibility when the icon conveys part of total label that
# is missing from the short_label_html. :(
#
# Order matters, in that order listed is order they will show up in edit form select.
#
# The icon_alt is used for an alt attribute (and maybe `title` attribute) on a large-format
# icon when short_label_html is displayed next to it, in most cases alt attribute is
# needed in addition to short_label_html to completely describe the statement. If it's
# clear that NO alt text is needed, add `icon_alt: ""`, so an empty string
# alt will be added appropriately for assistive technology.
